# Annotation and blocks workstream evidence

Scope: F-057..F-068 and F-087..F-091 from Reio's selected scope.

This workstream contains typed core planners, immutable extension contracts, feature-intent UI
modules and unit/golden/mutation tests. It intentionally contains no AutoCAD evidence and no
DXF/PDF adapter changes. Therefore no owned F-row is promoted to `1.00` here.

Local targeted verification on 2026-08-31:

- six Vitest files;
- 22 targeted tests passed;
- dimension and hatch stable-handle association updates covered;
- nested block cycle rejection covered;
- BLOCK, BEDIT, EXPLODE and association batches covered by atomic Undo/Redo tests;
- golden JSON contracts checked for dimensions, hatch metadata, block definitions and inserts.

The first full repository regression after implementation passed 92 Vitest files / 543 tests.

Full repository gates and final commit SHA are recorded in the delivery report after completion.
