# Documents I/O integration contract

Branch source: `work/reio-documents-io` from `b09f4e1e0a661b06e5087e6cbb748220dbc48574`.

This workstream deliberately does not modify `App.tsx`, `style.css`, package manifests, parity scores or security evidence. The integration owner must wire the following surfaces without weakening the existing F-097...F-107, F-109, F-111 and F-114 paths.

## Shared package exports

Already exported by `@kuubik/cad-dxf`:

- `openDxfDocument`
- `readBackOpenedDxf`
- `DxfOpenOptions`, `DxfOpenReadback`, `DxfOpenResult`

Already exported by `@kuubik/cad-print`:

- `inspectPdfUnderlay`
- `preparePdfUnderlay`
- `createPdfUnderlayPlacement`
- `PdfUnderlayError` and related types

Core integration module, intentionally not added to the shared barrel in this owned scope:

- `packages/cad-core/src/pdf-underlays.ts`
- exports required from `@kuubik/cad-core`: `addPdfUnderlay`, `readPdfUnderlays`, `assertPdfUnderlayPlacement`, `PDF_UNDERLAY_EXTENSION_KEY` and related types

The integration owner may add exactly this barrel export after resolving the atomic attachment transaction described below.

## Web document modules

- `model-space.ts`: `createNewModelSpaceDocument`, `openDxfInModelSpace`, `readBackModelSpaceDocument`
- `document-tabs.ts`: pure open/activate/update/save/layout/reorder/close/read-back state functions
- `DocumentTabs.tsx`: tab UI using the existing document-tab class names
- `PdfUnderlayView.tsx`: pointer-disabled, transformed browser PDF-object surface
- `autosave-recovery.ts`: `DocumentAutosaveRecovery` open/checkpoint/commit/close lifecycle
- `indexed-db.ts`: schema v2 attachment, append-only snapshot/operation and crash-event methods

## Required App wiring order

1. Replace the single visible tab shell with `DocumentTabs`, while retaining one `CadSession` per `documentId` and deriving the renderer document/layout from the active tab.
2. Route New/Open DXF through `createNewModelSpaceDocument` or `openDxfInModelSpace`; keep the existing DXFIN command unchanged for replacing content in the active document.
3. On each command, update only the active tab and call `DocumentAutosaveRecovery.commit` instead of calling `KDrawIndexedDb.commitRevision` directly.
4. Open each restored tab through the recovery coordinator before exposing it. Display unclean-session and ignored-tail information; never silently call a corrupt tail recovered.
5. PDF import order: `preparePdfUnderlay` -> `saveAttachment` -> atomic document attachment/placement command -> `PdfUnderlayView` beneath editable CAD geometry.
6. Close a dirty tab only after Save or an explicit discard decision. Record `clean` only after the exact current revision and all attachment writes are durable.

## Atomic attachment gap

`CadChange` currently has no attachment put/delete variant. Therefore `addPdfUnderlay` prepares and validates a complete next document, but App integration must first add transaction-level attachment changes with inverse changes so PDF attach/detach is one Undo/Redo step. Do not bypass the command transaction by mutating `document.attachments` in React state.

Until that shared transaction change and a PDF.js page renderer are integrated, F-115 remains a candidate rather than a complete browser workflow. The current object surface is a safe visual fallback for traditional uncompressed PDFs; compressed object streams and inherited page boxes fail closed.

## Native boundary

`tools/native/contracts.ts` must remain blocked until `assertLicensedNativeCapability` receives auditable ODA Drawings SDK or Autodesk RealDWG license evidence and a pinned runtime SHA-256. ODA File Converter, LibreDWG, LibreCAD and FreeCAD cannot unlock F-112/F-113/F-117/F-121.

## Integration acceptance

- Existing certified Layout/Page Setup/PDF/DXF tests remain byte-stable.
- DXF Open creates a new Model document; DXFIN continues to replace only active drawing content.
- Two documents retain independent revision, Undo/Redo, active layout, selection and viewport state.
- PDF bytes read back with the stored SHA-256 and do not become editable CAD geometry.
- A forced Chromium termination restores the last valid SHA-chained revision and visibly reports the unclean session.
- No native row is scored `1.00` without licensed adapter plus owned AutoCAD live roundtrip evidence.
